# 結論
割と満足いく結果が返された。
今後はプロンプトをテンプレート化し、それぞれの設計について深掘りしながら設計を効率化できるようにしていきたい。

例えば...
 - プロジェクトの概要や規模から必要な設計を絞り込む
 - 粒度の決定から工数試算→設計段階の見積もり作成まで落とし込みたい
 - 各設計資料のテンプレートを作成し、使いまわせるように出力する

## 作成手順
1. ChatGPTをベテランのエンジニアもしくはベテランのPMであると人格形成する
2. "必要な設計はどのようなものがあるか"の旨の質問をする
3. "2"を気が済むまで繰り返す
4. 一覧をリストにして出力してもらう
5. リストをChatGPTが考える優先順位でソートしてもらう
6. 設計書のテンプレート作成の依頼をする（出力形式などはここで指定する）
7. 気に入らなければ2指摘する

基本的に英語で質問・出力してから日本語へ翻訳する方が正確で早い。
